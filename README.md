# Shellsort in OpenCL

This is an implementation of Shellsort using OpenCL 1.2 library. It is a exercise 
 for the Research Master of Universidad Complutense de Madrid. The subject was 
 Modelado de solidos y técnicas de visualización(Modeling of solids and visualization techniques). 

## Motivation

This work was done as end-of-course exercise. The goal was to implement an search or sort algorithm using 
 Cuda / OpenCL library. This algorithm could not be the best to parallelize but It should 
 not have been implemented already. 

The work conclusions can be read in the documentation (In spanish). [Documentation](Documentation/Articulo/paper.pdf)
